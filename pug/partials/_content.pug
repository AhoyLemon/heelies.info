    b Achilles' Heelies
    | , a Force-sensitive human male, was an F Plus Ridiculist who celebrated his 30th Birthday amid the COVID lockdown on June 7th, 2020. Along with his companions Spaceboots Stargears, A'dumb Bozeart, and Fat Hank The Pissboy, Heelies liberated the Prisoners of Sandprison from the Evil Emperor Baaa'by, by playing the traditional space game known as Peek-A-Boo, and then freeing all the prisoners while The Emperor had his hands over his eyes. He also had a job at some place.

    b Achilles' Heelies
    |  USED to be a kick-ass Jedi assassin, before Disney came along and fucking changed everything. He was so cool that he could just straight murder people and he got to keep being a light side Jedi because the force was fine with it. Every time he'd do a sick flip and murder somebody, he'd pull down his shades and say something like "I guess you just couldn't handle the FORCE of my sword", or something, I dunno it was cooler when he said it. The following is an incomplete list

      a(href='#cite_note-Catalyst-1') [2]
    | . These socks were believed by some to imbue him with like, The Force, or whatever. Once, Queen Lasertits tried to trick Heelies into removing his socks, by uttering the famous phrase "Ba ba black sheep, have you any wool, I sure think your socks are cool." It's very important that you know Queen Lasertits was from a planet that pronounced the word "wool" with a long "ooo" sound, therefore it rhymed with the word "cool".

  h2 Screwdriver
  p A screwdriver was a device used for repairing or dismantling manufactured devices. They were typically made of space-metal, such as Stieelle or Aluminimiminiminiminimum, and are composed of a single cylander of space metal with a shape on one end, and then a handle (or "Hand Grib Device Quadrant", in Loovieum) where the user can grip the screwdriver. Screwdrivers do not have special powers and can't sedate animals or stop bullets. That's not a Star Wars thing, that's fucking

    | , Phillip! God, you're embarassing yourself.
  p Achilles Heelies owned a screwdriver that is black. He used to have another black screwdriver that he found on an off ramp, and he picked it up and carried for like five years, but eventually he lost it.
  p He also owned a three pound weight that he probably found on a different off-ramp. The purpose of the weight is unknown; Who the fuck needs a three pound weight?

      p.caption A slice of bread that has been toasted, but not a lot.
  
  p Throughout the latter part of

    | and into the majority of 
    strong The War Where Everything Seemed Like It Was Fine But Then The Robots Got Mad Again About How The Humans Treated Them
    | , toast was enjoyed by high ranking government officials as well as lowly staff like the guy that came over to fix My Mom's doorbell last week. I think his name was Carlos. He was weird. Mom wanted me to fix the doorbell but I told her I don't know anything about how doorbells work.

  p Toast was made by applying direct heat to bread. This was done in several ways, but the most common method for converting toast into bread was to use a specialized machine known colloquially as a "toaster" which had heated coils inside that would heat each slice of bread on both sides. Or you could use The Force.
  p Achilles Heelies preferred his toast to be only slightly toasted, which is basically just warm bread.

  p In

  p Possessing a skill known to very few Star Wars fans, Achilles could use The Force (and also natural gas, I suppose) to combine ingredients into a Mee'al. His methods for doing this are widely unknown, but it's believed that a spatula shaped like a guitar was involved.

  h2 Role in The LEGO® F Plus™

  p In the 
    strong The LEGO® F Plus™
    |  series of video games for the Xbox One, PlayStation 2, and Panty Panty Mahjong Tablet, the character of Achilles' Heelies does not show up until the third game in the series, 
    strong The LEGO® F Plus™ Jerk Off Every One Of The LEGO™ Harlem Globetrotters
    | . In the game, Heelies is actually portrayed by avante garde performer Diamonda Galas, which is actually just a re-recording of the 1982's "The Litanies of Satan", but nobody seemed to notice until press time.

  p The game received 98 out of 100 on IGN, the worst score of the entire series, with video game journalist Rich Whiteman saying of the subplot where Heelies separates from the rest of the group in order to find one of several hundred thousand special bricks was a victory of the SJWs which somehow ruined his childhood. He then went on to describe his recurring sexual fantasy where he's decapitated by the lady from Lollipop Chainsaw.
